This portfolio consists of Machine Learning projects that I worked on either in college or on my own.

## #1 Project. Housing Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

- **Project Overview**

I worked on this problem set while taking a course named Multivariate Analaysis at the University of Minnesota. In class, we were just given training set and test set, but I rather took a different approach this time by using k-fold cross validation for model assessment.

   (2) Data Pre-processing  
   - EDA  
   
   
   (3) Methods
   - Linear Regression

   - Housing Price Prediction Report
   
   
   (5) Review  
   
    While working on this problem set, I enjoyed taking different approaches by using a slightly advanced method (validation set approach -> k-fold cross validation) and by trying out different codes (which sometimes involes hardcoding but it definitely helps me understand how the model works). Next time I will apply different maching learning models and see if there are any better models to predict housing price!
